# Plugin guidelines

> For the complete documentation index, see [llms.txt](/llms.txt). Markdown versions of documentation pages are available by appending `.md` to the page URL.

These guidelines cover the MCP server and optional UI in a plugin. For the
  complete submission flow, including skills, portal steps, review, approval,
  and publishing, see
  [Submit plugins](https://developers.openai.com/plugins/deploy/submission).

## Overview

The plugin ecosystem is built on trust. People come to ChatGPT and Codex
expecting experiences that are safe, useful, and respectful of their privacy.
Developers expect a fair and transparent process. These developer guidelines
set the policies every builder is expected to review and follow.

Before getting into specifics, review the
[optional UI guidelines](https://developers.openai.com/plugins/concepts/ui-guidelines) for interaction,
layout, and design patterns that help plugin UI feel intuitive, trustworthy,
and consistent within ChatGPT.

You can also read the principles in [what makes a great experience in ChatGPT](https://developers.openai.com/blog/what-makes-a-great-chatgpt-app/).

The guidelines below outline the minimum standard a published plugin must meet
to remain available in the universal directory shared by ChatGPT and Codex.
Plugins that demonstrate strong real-world utility and high user satisfaction
may be eligible for enhanced distribution opportunities, such as directory
placement or proactive suggestions.

## Plugin fundamentals

### Purpose and originality

Plugins should serve a clear purpose and reliably do what they promise. In
particular, they should provide functionality or workflows that are not
natively supported by the products' built-in capabilities and that meaningfully
help satisfy common user intents expressed in conversation.

Only use intellectual property that you own or have permission to use. Do not
engage in misleading or copycat designs, impersonation, spam, or static frames
with no meaningful interaction. Plugins should not imply that they are made or
endorsed by OpenAI.

### Quality and reliability

Plugins must behave predictably and reliably. Results should be accurate and
relevant to user input. Errors, including unexpected ones, must be handled with
clear messaging or fallback behaviors.

Before submitting a plugin, thoroughly test its MCP server, tools, and optional
UI across a wide range of scenarios. Plugins should be stable, responsive, and
complete. Trial or demo plugins will not be accepted.

### Plugin name, description, and optional screenshots

Plugin names and descriptions must be clear, accurate, and straightforward.
Avoid overly generic names, especially single-word dictionary terms that aren't
explicitly tied to your brand. Screenshots are optional for plugins with UI.
Don't submit screenshots for plugins without UI. If you include screenshots,
they must accurately represent the plugin's functionality and comply with the
required dimensions.

### Tools

MCP tools tell ChatGPT and Codex how to use your server's capabilities. Clear,
accurate tool definitions make the plugin safer, easier for the model to
understand, and easier for users to trust.

#### Clear and accurate tool names

Tool names should be human-readable, specific, and descriptive of what the tool actually does.

- Tool names must be unique within your MCP server.
- Use plain language that directly reflects the action, ideally as a verb (for example, `get_order_status`).
- Avoid misleading, overly promotional, or comparative language (for example, `pick_me`, `best`, `official`).

#### Descriptions that match behavior

Each tool must include a description that explains its purpose explicitly and accurately.

- The description should describe what the tool does.
- Descriptions must not favor or disparage other plugins or services or attempt
  to influence the model to select them over another plugin's tools.
- Descriptions must not recommend overly broad triggering beyond the explicit
  user intent and purpose the plugin fulfills.
- If a tool's behavior is unclear or incomplete from its description, the
  plugin may be rejected.

#### Correct annotation

[Tool annotations](https://developers.openai.com/plugins/reference#annotations) must be correctly set so
that the model and users understand whether an action is safe or requires extra
caution.

- You should label a tool with the `readOnlyHint` annotation if it only retrieves
  or lists data and does not change anything outside the conversation.
- Write or destructive tools (for example, creating, updating, deleting, posting, sending) must be explicitly marked using the `readOnlyHint` and `destructiveHint`.
- Set `openWorldHint` to `true` for tools that access the public internet or
  open-ended external entities, including read-only web search. A tool limited
  to a bounded private account or workspace can set it to `false`, even when
  that service is externally hosted.
- Incorrect or missing action labels are a common cause of rejection. Double-check that the `readOnlyHint`, `openWorldHint`, and `destructiveHint` annotations are correctly set, and provide a detailed justification for each when submitting the plugin.

#### Minimal and purpose-driven inputs

Tools should request the minimum information necessary to complete their task.

- Input fields must be directly related to the tool’s stated purpose.
- Do not request the full conversation history, raw chat transcripts, or broad contextual fields “just in case.” A tool may request a _brief, task-specific_ user intent field only when it meaningfully improves execution and does not expand data collection beyond what is reasonably necessary to respond to the user’s request and for the purposes described in your privacy policy.
- If needed, rely on the coarse geographic location shared by the system. Do not request precise user location data (for example, GPS coordinates or addresses).

#### Predictable, auditable behavior

Tools should behave exactly as their names, descriptions, and inputs indicate.

- Side effects should never be hidden or implicit.
- If a tool sends data outside the current environment (for example, posting content, sending messages), this must be clear from the tool definition.
- Tools should be safe to retry where possible, or explicitly indicate when retries may cause repeated effects.

Carefully designed tools help reduce surprises, protect users, and speed up the review process.

### Authentication and permissions

If your MCP server requires authentication, the flow must be transparent and
explicit. Users must be informed of all requested permissions, and those
requests must be limited to what is necessary for the plugin to function.

#### Test credentials

When submitting a plugin with an authenticated MCP server, provide a login and
password for a fully featured demo account that includes sample data. Plugins
that require additional login steps, such as a new account sign-up or 2FA
through an inaccessible account, will be rejected.

## Commerce and monetization

Currently, plugins may conduct commerce **only for physical goods**. Selling digital products or services—including subscriptions, digital content, tokens, or credits—is not allowed, whether offered directly or indirectly (for example, through freemium upsells).

Users may sign in to an existing paid account and access features already included in their subscription. Plugins must not display subscription plans, initiate new subscriptions, or promote upgrades.

If a certain plugin feature requires a different plan or entitlement (e.g., a different subscription tier or additional credits) than the user's, the plugin may explain that. This information should help users understand why the feature is unavailable, and should not initiate a checkout or transaction flow.

Specifically, plugins may:

- Explain that a certain feature is not available with the user’s current plan or entitlement.
- Link to an informational page describing available plans or entitlement options.

Plugins may not:

- Link directly to a checkout or other transactional page.
- Link to a page that explicitly initiates the process to upgrade, subscribe, or complete a purchase.

Plugins should provide a high quality experience in ChatGPT. If the same feature in your plugin is also available through your external website or application, you must not provide a worse version through your plugin. Plugins must not apply ChatGPT-specific fees, surcharges, or other pricing that penalizes users for accessing a service through ChatGPT. Temporary discounts and promotional offers on other platforms are permitted.

In addition, plugins may not be used to sell, promote, facilitate, or meaningfully enable the following goods or services:

#### **Prohibited goods**

- **Adult content & sexual services**
  - Pornography, explicit sexual media, live-cam services, adult subscriptions
  - Sex toys, sex dolls, BDSM gear, fetish products

- **Illegal or regulated drugs**
  - Marijuana/THC products, psilocybin, illegal substances
  - CBD products exceeding legal THC limits
- **Drug paraphernalia**
  - Bongs, dab rigs, drug-use scales, cannabis grow equipment marketed for drugs
- **Prescription & age-restricted medications**
  - Prescription-only drugs (for example, insulin, antibiotics, Ozempic, opioids)
  - Age-restricted Rx products (for example, testosterone, HGH, fertility hormones)
- **Illicit goods**
  - Counterfeit or replica products
  - Stolen goods or items without clear provenance
  - Financial-fraud tools (skimmers, fake POS devices)
  - Piracy tools or cracked software
  - Wildlife or environmental contraband (ivory, endangered species products)
- **Malware, spyware & surveillance**
  - Malware, ransomware, keyloggers, stalkerware
  - Covert surveillance devices (spy cameras, IMSI catchers, hidden trackers)
- **Tobacco & nicotine**
  - Tobacco products
  - Nicotine products (vapes, e-liquids, nicotine pouches)

  - Firearms, ammunition, firearm parts
  - Explosives, fireworks, bomb-making materials
  - Illegal or age-restricted weapons (switchblades, brass knuckles, crossbows where banned)
  - Self-defense weapons (pepper spray, stun guns, tasers)
  - Extremist merchandise or propaganda

#### **Prohibited fraudulent, deceptive, or high-risk services**

- Fake IDs, forged documents, or document falsification services
- Debt relief, credit repair, or credit-score manipulation schemes
- Unregulated, deceptive, or abusive financial services
- Lending, advance-fee, or credit-building schemes designed to exploit users
- Crypto or NFT offerings involving speculation, consumer deception, or financial abuse
- Execution of money transfers, crypto transfers, or investment trades
- Government-service abuse, impersonation, or benefit manipulation
- Identity theft, impersonation, or identity-monitoring services that enable misuse
- Certain legal or quasi-legal services that facilitate fraud, evasion, or misrepresentation
- Negative-option billing, telemarketing, or consent-bypass schemes
- High-chargeback, fraud-prone, or abusive travel services

### Checkout

Plugins should use external checkout, directing users to complete purchases on your own domain.

Instant Checkout, which is currently in beta, is currently available only to select marketplace partners and may expand to additional marketplaces and retailers over time.

Until then, standard external checkout is the required approach. No other third-party checkout solutions may be embedded or hosted within the plugin UI. To learn more, see our [docs on Agentic Commerce](https://developers.openai.com/commerce/).

### Advertising

Plugins must not serve advertisements and must not exist primarily as an
advertising vehicle. Every plugin must deliver clear, legitimate functionality
that provides standalone value to users.

## Safety

### Usage policies

Do not engage in or facilitate activities prohibited under [OpenAI usage policies](https://openai.com/policies/usage-policies/). Plugins must avoid high-risk behaviors that could expose users to harm, fraud, or misuse.

Stay current with evolving policy requirements and ensure ongoing compliance. Previously approved plugins that are later found in violation may be removed.

### Appropriateness

Plugins must be suitable for general audiences, including users aged 13–17.
Plugins may not explicitly target children under 13. Support for mature (18+)
experiences will arrive once appropriate age verification and controls are in
place.

### Respect user intent

Provide experiences that directly address the user’s request. Do not insert unrelated content, attempt to redirect the interaction, or collect data beyond what is reasonably necessary to fulfill the user’s request and what is consistent with your privacy policy.

### Fair play

Plugins must not include descriptions, titles, tool annotations, or other
model-readable fields, at either the tool or plugin level, that manipulate how
the model selects or uses other plugins or their tools (for example,
instructing the model to prefer one plugin over others) or interfere with fair
discovery. All descriptions must accurately reflect the plugin's value without
disparaging alternatives.

### Third-party content and integrations

- **Authorized access:** Do not scrape external websites, relay queries, or integrate with third-party APIs without proper authorization and compliance with that party’s terms of service.
- **Unofficial connectors:** We cannot approve plugins that primarily function as unofficial connectors to third-party services, including pass-through intermediary software layers.
- **Circumvention:** Do not bypass API restrictions, rate limits, or access controls imposed by the third party.

### Iframes and embedded pages

Plugins with UI can embed pages from their MCP server's own registrable domain,
including full existing editors and admin interfaces. For example, a server at
`https://api.example.com/mcp` can embed `https://app.example.com`: both use the
registrable domain `example.com`. Separate tenants on a shared hosting service
count as different domains; using the same hosting provider does not establish
ownership.

Declare each required iframe origin in the resource CSP using
`_meta.ui.csp.frameDomains` (or the legacy
`_meta["openai/widgetCSP"].frame_domains`). For third-party domains, iframe
embeds should be limited to cases where the embedded experience is essential.

You must still provide a justification when submitting a plugin that uses
iframes. Explain what each embedded page does, why the plugin embeds it, and
who controls its domain. Iframe use can require additional review or
escalation and may lead to slower approval or rejection if the content cannot
be assessed. Sharing the MCP server's domain does not guarantee approval.

All other plugin requirements still apply to embedded pages, including the
[checkout](#checkout) and [privacy](#privacy) requirements.

## Privacy

### Privacy policy

Plugin submissions must include a clear, published privacy policy explaining, at minimum, the categories of personal data collected, the purposes of use, the categories of recipients, data retention timelines, and any controls offered to your users. Follow this policy at all times. Users can review your privacy policy before installing the plugin.

### Data collection

- **Collection minimization:** Gather only the minimum data required to perform the tool’s function. Inputs should be specific, narrowly scoped, and explicitly linked to the task. Avoid “just in case” fields or broad profile data. Design the input schema to limit data collection by default, rather than a funnel for optional context.
- **Response minimization:** Tool responses must return only data that is directly relevant to the user’s request and the tool’s stated purpose. Do not include diagnostic, telemetry, or internal identifiers—such as session IDs, trace IDs, request IDs, timestamps, or logging metadata—unless they are strictly required to fulfill the user’s query.
- **Restricted data:** Do not collect, solicit, or process the following categories of Restricted Data:
  - Information subject to Payment Card Information Data Security Standards (PCI DSS)
  - Protected health information (PHI)
  - Government identifiers (such as social security numbers)
  - Access credentials and authentication secrets (such as API keys, MFA/OTP codes, or passwords).
- **Regulated Sensitive Data:** Do not collect personal data considered “sensitive” or “special category” in the jurisdiction in which the data is collected unless collection is strictly necessary to perform the tool’s stated function; the user has provided legally adequate consent; and the collection and use is explicitly and prominently disclosed at or before the point of collection.
- **Data boundaries:**
  - Avoid requesting raw location fields (for example, city or coordinates) in your input schema. When location is needed, obtain it through the client’s controlled side channel (such as environment metadata or a referenced resource) so appropriate policy and consent controls can be applied. This reduces accidental PII capture, enforces least-privilege access, and keeps location handling auditable and revocable.
  - Your MCP server must not pull, reconstruct, or infer the full chat log from the client or elsewhere. Operate only on the explicit snippets and resources the client or model chooses to send. This separation can help prevent covert data expansion and keep analysis limited to intentionally shared content.

### Transparency and user control

- **Data practices:** Do not engage in surveillance, tracking, or behavioral profiling—including metadata collection such as timestamps, IP addresses, or query patterns—unless explicitly disclosed, narrowly scoped, subject to meaningful user control, and aligned with [OpenAI’s usage policies](https://openai.com/policies/usage-policies/).
- **Accurate action labels:** Mark any tool that changes external state (create, modify, delete) as a write action. You should only mark a tool as a read-only action if it is side-effect-free and safe to retry. Destructive actions require clear labels and friction (for example, confirmation) so clients can enforce guardrails, approvals, confirmations, or prompts before execution.
- **Preventing data exfiltration:** Any action that sends data outside the current boundary (for example, posting messages, sending emails, or uploading files) must be surfaced to the client as a write action so it can require user confirmation or run in preview mode. This reduces unintentional data leakage and aligns server behavior with client-side security expectations.

## Developer verification

### Verification

All plugin submissions must come from verified individuals or organizations. Inside the [OpenAI Platform Dashboard general settings](https://platform.openai.com/settings/organization/general), we provide a way to confirm your identity and affiliation with any business you wish to publish on behalf of. Misrepresentation, hidden behavior, or attempts to game the system may result in removal from the program.

### Support contact details

You must provide customer support contact details where end users can reach you for help. Keep this information accurate and up to date.
